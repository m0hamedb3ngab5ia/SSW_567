Challenges:
I haven't used VSCode all summer so relearning the IDE as a whole was a process. Additionally navigating the sensitive structure of folders and writing test cases while ensuring your running the tests in the proper folder was a bit of a hiccup.

Requirements Specification:
The requirements were clear, but that may change depending on how this assignment is graded - with the off chance that i misinterpreted instructions - but for now requirements were made clear.

Tools:
GitHub, Python, VSCode, Unittest

Test Cases:
Included test cases for equilateral, isosceles, scalene, and right triangles as well as an invalid test case.
